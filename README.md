This code simulates the sound wave produced by a vibrating string based on physical parameters such as string material, tension, and length. Using harmonic frequency models, it calculates the fundamental frequency and overtones of the string. The resulting waveform shows how changes in string properties affect pitch, timbre, and resonance. However, it is incomplete. Acoustic enhancements like sympathetic string resonance, convolution with body impulse responces, and a detailed soundboard or instrument body vibration model are not yet implemented. These elements are essential for capturing the full richness and realism of an asoustic instrument's tone and will be added in future updates.
